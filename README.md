# Haunted Website
## Description

This is a mock-up website I created for my Web Development 1 class. This website is for a haunted house and includes the following features.
 - Button to switch between light and dark mode
 - Embedded Youtube video on the home page
 - Ticket page where you can choose the date you would like to attend
 - Location page
 - Contact page. Has email and phone information, and allows user to submit their own email for inquiries
 - Visitor Form. This allows users to enter their information for the business's survey. It also submits the form to a list that is shown below the visitor form.
